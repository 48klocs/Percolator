So.  [/u/ebolaxb](https://www.reddit.com/user/ebolaxb) created these handy-dandy guides for [god roll PvE weapons](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/5nkjiy/pve_god_roll_quick_reference_guide/) and [god roll PvP weapons](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/5nk2o2/pvp_god_roll_quick_reference_guide/).

Which is awesome and all, but I am a very important person and have very important things to do, and the thought of cross-referencing my inventory against a known good list of gear kind of made my brain hurt.

So.  If you happen to use [Destiny Item Manager](https://destinyitemmanager.com/), go to Settings -> Download Spreadsheets and choose weapons.

Open that CSV file up and paste the text  in to the textarea, then ask it nicely to find you some community-blessed gear.  It probably will!  Like, I really hope it will.
