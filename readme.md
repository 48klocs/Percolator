So.  [/u/ebolaxb](https://www.reddit.com/user/ebolaxb) created these handy-dandy guides for [god roll PvE weapons](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/5nkjiy/pve_god_roll_quick_reference_guide/) and [god roll PvP weapons](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/5nk2o2/pvp_god_roll_quick_reference_guide/).

Which is awesome and all, but I am a very important person and have very important things to do, and the thought of cross-referencing my inventory against a known good list of gear kind of made my brain hurt.  So [I built a little tool that automates that for you.](https://48klocs.github.io/Percolator/)

So.  If you happen to use [Destiny Item Manager](https://destinyitemmanager.com/), go to Settings -> Download Spreadsheets and choose weapons.

Open that CSV file up and paste the text  in to the textarea, then ask it nicely to find you some community-blessed gear.  It probably will!  Like, I really hope it will.

By default, it uses my inventory, which I admit is less useful for you than for me.

You can see the spreadsheets that is uses for its PvE/PvP rolls here.

If you have a roll that makes you happy, I've added a new add and translate (DIM data) feature.  Paste your sweet roll from DIM's CSV output in to the box and tell it whether it's a PvE or PvP roll.  It'll add it to the list of known good weapons and reflect it the next time you find blessed weapons.  It'll also generate CSV that you can send me.
