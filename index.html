        <h1>
            If you have a weapon that's close to the "god roll", Percolator will output the perk loadout for the god roll, not necessarily the perk loadout of the weapon in your inventory.  I didn't mean to confuse anyone, this (having it tell me which perks to pick) just made sense to me.

        <p>In Destiny Item Manager, go to settings and export your weapons spreadsheet.  Paste it (from a text editor) in to the top text area and find you some blessed weapons.</p>
        <p>If the output seems confused, it could be!  It'll report back on close matches by reporting on what the god roll perk layout is (so that you can pick the perks on the weapon that you have, even though, again, it might not have all the perks from the "ideal" roll.)</p>
        <p>If you have a weapon that's missing from the list, don't get mad at me!  Paste that item (or those items) in the bottom text area and tell it to add them to the list.  Take the output and send it to me and I'll tack it on to the list.</p>
        <p>Consider this a virtual hug from your old pal @48klocs / /u/48klocs.  If you're baffled, there's a readme over at <a href="https://github.com/48klocs/Percolator">the GitHub page</a>.</p>
        <p>If you see mayor_sloth on the PSN, maybe don't be so quick to shoot me in the face?</p>
